# Test Scripts

This directory contains various test scenarios for the MCP Selenium Server to verify browser automation functionality and multi-browser management.

## Available Test Scripts

### Core Functionality Tests

- **`test-simple-mcp.js`** - Basic MCP communication test

  - Tests `list_tools` and `open_browser` functionality
  - Verifies JSON-RPC communication works correctly
  - Quick smoke test for basic functionality

- **`test-browser-state-persistence.js`** - Browser state persistence test
  - Tests single browser instance state management
  - Verifies URL navigation and page title changes
  - Confirms browser maintains state between operations

### Multi-Browser Management Tests

- **`test-multi-browser-scenario.js`** - Multi-browser instance management

  - Tests opening multiple browser instances with unique IDs
  - Verifies independent browser state management
  - Confirms no port conflicts between instances
  - Tests concurrent operations on different browsers

### Debug and Development Tools

- **`debug-browser-sessions.js`** - Browser session debugging

  - Opens two browsers and performs basic operations
  - Useful for debugging browser management issues
  - Provides detailed output for troubleshooting

- **`test-browser-persistence.js`** - Browser persistence verification

  - Tests that browsers stay open between operations
  - Verifies browser instances are properly managed

- **`test-console-logs.js`** - Console log capture test

  - Tests browser console log reading functionality
  - Verifies console log capture works correctly

- **`test-multi-browser-flow.js`** - Complex multi-browser flow
  - Advanced multi-browser interaction testing
  - Tests complex scenarios with multiple browser instances

## Running Test Scripts

### Prerequisites

1. Build the project:

   ```bash
   make build
   # or
   npm run build
   ```

2. Ensure no existing Chrome processes are running:
   ```bash
   pkill -f chrome
   pkill -f chromedriver
   ```

### Running Individual Tests

```bash
# Basic functionality test
node test/scripts/test-simple-mcp.js

# Browser state persistence test
node test/scripts/test-browser-state-persistence.js

# Multi-browser management test
node test/scripts/test-multi-browser-scenario.js


# Debug browser sessions
node test/scripts/debug-browser-sessions.js
```

### Using Make Commands

```bash
# List available test scenarios
make test-scenarios

# Run unit tests
make test

# Build and run tests
make build test
```

## Test Results Interpretation

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators

- All responses show `"isError": false`
- Browser instances open successfully
- Navigation and interactions work correctly
- Multiple browsers can run simultaneously
- Browser state persists between operations

### ‚ùå Common Issues

- **Port conflicts**: Multiple browsers trying to use same debugging port
- **Session errors**: "session not created from disconnected: unable to connect to renderer"
- **Browser not found**: Browser ID routing issues
- **Timeout errors**: Elements not found within specified time

### üîß Troubleshooting

1. **Clear existing processes**:

   ```bash
   pkill -f chrome
   pkill -f chromedriver
   ```

2. **Check for port conflicts**:

   ```bash
   netstat -tulpn | grep :922
   ```

3. **Verify Chrome installation**:

   ```bash
   google-chrome --version
   chromedriver --version
   ```

4. **Check system resources**:
   ```bash
   free -h
   ps aux | grep chrome
   ```

## Test Scenarios Explained

### Multi-Browser Management

The system supports multiple independent browser instances identified by unique IDs:

- Each browser maintains its own state (URL, cookies, session data)
- Browsers can be operated concurrently
- Each browser uses unique debugging ports and user data directories
- Browser instances persist until explicitly closed

### Browser State Persistence

Browsers maintain their state throughout the test:

- URL navigation is preserved
- Page content and form data persist
- Browser settings and preferences are maintained
- Console logs and network activity are captured

## Contributing

When adding new test scripts:

1. Follow the naming convention: `test-*.js` or `debug-*.js`
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Provide clear success/failure indicators
4. Document the test purpose in comments
5. Update this README with test description

## Notes

- All test scripts use ES modules (`import`/`export`)
- Tests communicate with the MCP server via JSON-RPC
- Browser instances are created with unique IDs to avoid conflicts
- Tests are designed to be run independently or in sequence
- Each test cleans up after itself (closes MCP process)
