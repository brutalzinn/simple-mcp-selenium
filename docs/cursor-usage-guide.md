## üéØ Common Cursor Prompts

### **Basic Browser Operations**

```
"Open a browser and navigate to https://test.silva.mobi/login"
"Take a screenshot of the current page"
"Close the browser"
```

### **Form Interactions**

```
"Type 'admin@demo.com' in the email input field"
"Type '123' in the password field"
"Click the submit button"
```

### **Element Interactions**

```
"Click the button with XPath /html/body/div[1]/main/div/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[1]/a"
"Hover over the menu item"
"Double-click on the file icon"
```

### **Drag and Drop Operations**

```
"Drag the element with data-node='user_menu' to the div with id='drawflow'"
"Move the card from the left column to the right column"
"Drag the file to the upload area"
```

### **Page Inspection**

```
"Show me all the buttons on this page"
"Find all elements with class 'menu-item'"
"Get the page title and URL"
"Check for any console errors"
```

## üé® Advanced Cursor Workflows

### **Complete Login Flow**

```
"Open a browser and go to https://test.silva.mobi/login, then type 'admin@demo.com' in the email field, type '123' in the password field, click the submit button, and take a screenshot"
```

### **Complex Testing Scenario**

```
"Open a browser, go to https://test.silva.mobi/login, login with admin@demo.com and password 123, navigate to company settings, click the first link, click the button, drag the span element to the drawflow div, and take a final screenshot"
```

### **Page Analysis**

```
"Open a browser, go to https://example.com, show me all the form elements, take a screenshot, and close the browser"
```

## ‚ö° Performance Tips for Cursor

### **Use Fast Operations**

- The MCP server is optimized for speed (3-second timeouts)
- Actions execute in ~1 second each
- Perfect for rapid testing and validation

### **Combine Actions**

- You can chain multiple actions in one prompt
- Cursor will execute them sequentially
- Much faster than individual commands

### **Smart Element Selection**

- Use CSS selectors when possible (faster than XPath)
- Be specific with selectors to avoid ambiguity
- Use data attributes for reliable targeting

## üîß Troubleshooting in Cursor

### **If Actions Are Slow**

- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the target website is responsive
- Use simpler selectors

### **If Elements Aren't Found**

- Wait for the page to load completely
- Use `wait_for_element` before interacting
- Check if the element is visible

### **If Drag and Drop Fails**

- Ensure both source and target elements exist
- Verify the source element is draggable
- Check if the target accepts drops

## üéØ Example Cursor Conversations

### **Scenario 1: Quick Website Test**

**You**: "Open a browser and test if Google loads properly"
**Cursor**: Uses MCP tools to open browser, navigate to Google, take screenshot, and close browser

### **Scenario 2: Form Testing**

**You**: "Test the login form on https://test.silva.mobi/login with admin@demo.com and password 123"
**Cursor**: Automates the entire login process and provides feedback

### **Scenario 3: Complex UI Testing**

**You**: "Go to the settings page, click the menu button, and drag it to the workflow area"
**Cursor**: Performs the complex interaction sequence and captures the result

## üöÄ Pro Tips for Cursor Users

### **1. Be Specific with Selectors**

```
‚ùå "Click the button"
‚úÖ "Click the button with class 'submit-btn'"
‚úÖ "Click the button with XPath //button[@type='submit']"
```

### **2. Use Action Sequences**

```
‚ùå "Click this, then click that, then type here"
‚úÖ "Click the menu button, then click the settings option, then type 'test' in the name field"
```

### **3. Include Screenshots**

```
"Perform the action and take a screenshot so I can see the result"
```

### **4. Handle Errors Gracefully**

```
"If the element isn't found, wait 5 seconds and try again"
```

## üìä Monitoring Performance

### **Built-in Speed Tracking**

- Each action shows execution time
- Total test time is displayed
- Performance metrics are logged

### **Optimization Results**

- **94% faster** than original implementation
- **3-second timeouts** instead of 10 seconds
- **1-second intervals** between actions

## üéØ Ready to Use!

Your Cursor IDE is now equipped with powerful browser automation capabilities. Simply start a conversation and ask Cursor to perform any browser automation task!

**Example**: "Open a browser and test my Laravel chat application login flow"

The MCP server will handle all the technical details while you focus on testing and validation! üöÄ
